# Parameters to build a top-hat band:
# - nsteps sets the number of frequencies used in the band integration
# - bandwidth sets the relative width of the band wrt the central frequency
#   the central frequency of each band is set from the bands stored in the sacc file
#     - with nstep: 1, bandwidth must be 0
#     Dirac delta bandpass, no band integration
#     useful if you don't want to do band integration
#     when the bandpasses in the sacc file are multifrequency
#     the freq used is the effective frequency from the bandpass
#     - if nstep > 1,  bandwidth must be > 1
#     bandwidth can be a list if you want a different width for each band
#     e.g. bandwidth: [0.3,0.2,0.3] for 3 bands
# when top_hat_band is a null dict: no top-hat band is built and
# bandpasses read from sacc file. Band integration is performed accordingly
# (if bandpass in sacc is a single freq, no band integration)
# the default is to read bandpasses from file, to build top-hat uncomment the
# parameters of the block!
# Bandpass has to be divided by nu^2 if measured with respect to a RJ source
# the nu^2 factor is set back again in the _bandpass_construction function

#  nsteps: 1
#  bandwidth: 0


# specify if the beam profile has to be from an external file or from sacc
# - if beam_from_file: "filename", the code will read the beams from this external file
#   the file name has to be its absolute path, with the yaml extension
#   it has to be a yaml with keys = experiments and items = array((freqs, ells))
#   i.e. numpy arrays of beam profiles for each frequency in the passband of that array
#   if beam_from_file: null, the code will read the beams from the sacc file
# - If bandpass shifts are != 0 and you want to propagate them to the beams, you have to fill 
#   the Bandpass_shifted_beams key with the name of the file containing the dictionary 
#   with beam profiles for different values of Delta nu. As before, the file should be a yaml, 
#   and you should provide its absolute path with the ".yaml" extension. 
#   The dictionary should contain a key for each experiment/array, and for each of these keys 
#   there should be a "nu_0", "alpha" and "beams" keys. The "beams" item would be a 
#   dictionary {"nu_0 + Delta nu": b_ell, "nu_0 + 2Delta nu": b'_ell,...}   
# default is the beam_profile to be a null dict and chromatic beam not 
# taken into account. To include this effect and read beams from sacc, just use "beam_profile: // beam_from_file: null".

#  beam_from_file: "filename"/null
